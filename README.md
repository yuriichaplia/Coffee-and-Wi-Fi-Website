# Coffee and Wifi Website  
A Flask web app that contains a collection of cafes with data on power socket availability, wifi speed and coffee quality with the opportunity to add new cafes.  

#### To get started you need to create .env file in the root folder with 'SECRET_KEY' variable. Note, that this variable can be generated using python (e.g. import secrets, secrets.token_hex(16)) or you can create one manually (e.g. SECRET_KEY = 'mysupersecretkey'). If you want to add your cafe/cafes to the collection navigate to '/add' in the address bar (there is no add cafes button).
